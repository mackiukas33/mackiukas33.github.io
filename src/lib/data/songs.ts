    lyrics: `And I already heard what you said already, 
  You ain't even pause already
  Late night talks already...
  Troubles got u on, don't know where to go
  So you lost already
  Yeah,
  Saying I ain't did you right
  So tell me what you like
  Don't try me

    lyrics: `'Cause i loved you with my eyes closed
  Take off my blindfold
  My heart is ice cold now
  You left me stranded
  And took my heart for granted
  And now you're nowhere to be found`,

    lyrics: `Thats my shawty knowing all the facts
  She wont get attached
  Breaking all the rules she thought i won't last
  She saw me, we ain't speaking
  she just want it back
  Running round in circles
  there's no coming back
  thats how you do.
  
  Gifts and all designers 
  if you wanted these - that's for you 
  When you ready - come 
  ama set a table just for two.
  Miss the time we spent 
  right under the moon.
  Just me and you, me and you`,

    lyrics: `I'm taking my time now
  Slow down when it's getting loud
  Counting my days till you come around 

  Caught beneath stars, thousands
  Counting the scars, I'm bound in
  Missing your voice
  Wishing your voice would ground me

  I'm caught beneath stars in thousands
  Wishing you'd show the way
  Feel like it's all too late`,

    lyrics: `Things around we 
  Hoping I stopped  your heart bleed
  Hoping it's hope that I bring 
  All of the stuff that we did 

  Telling all your thoughts by noon
  I won't cut u off but it's the truth
  Had some things, didn't wanna tell u that
  Bought u some things, u gets to show it off`,

    lyrics: `Many things I heard a billion times 
They said love don't last for while (uuuh)
â€¦
I know 
Open hearts always heals fast 
I know 
Get your bag and always watch you backs yeah I know 
And all this love is fading on the grass, 
yeah I know
I know (uuh)
