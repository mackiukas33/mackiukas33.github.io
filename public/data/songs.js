  You ain't even pause already
  Late night talks already...
  Troubles got u on, don't know where to go
  So you lost already
  Yeah,
  Saying I ain't did you right
  So tell me what you like
  Don't try me

  Take off my blindfold
  My heart is ice cold now
  You left me stranded
  And took my heart for granted
  And now you’re nowhere to be found`,

    lyrics: `Thats my shawty knowing all the facts
  She wont get attached
  Breaking all the rules she thought i won't last
  She saw me, we ain't speaking
  she just want it back
  Running round in circles
  there's no coming back
  thats how you do.
  
  Gifts and all designers 
  if you wanted these - that’s for you 
  When you ready - come 
  ama set a table just for two.
  Miss the time we spent 
  right under the moon.
  Just me and you, me and you`,
